This is a simple project.

It's a typing effect seen on some websites.

I like the effect and so I implement it in this repo...and will make it 
a simple page just showing off the effect.

It's made using a simple HTML page, CSS3 and Vanilla JavaScript.

This is to show more of my understanding and knowledge of VanillaJS.

Thanks to Brad Traversy for the guide on how to do this.

Enjoy and let me know what you think.

Regards and thanks for viewing.
